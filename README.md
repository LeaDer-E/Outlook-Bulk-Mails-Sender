## Optimizations

in order that when We Try to Send More and More E-Mails, Application will stop trmporary because spamming issue, we have to open the code and remove the mail that we have send to it, then try run application later.

## Known Issues

Any issues are usually because the underlying browser automation framework has a
bug or inconsistency. Where possible, we try to cover up these underlying
problems in the client, but sometimes workarounds require higher-level
intervention.
try to restart the code or change the vedio link
Please feel free to file an [issue][issue] if this client doesn't work as
expected.
