34     to_addresses = ['E-Mail@Example.com', 'E-Mail@Example.com', 'E-Mail@Example.com'] >> Change The E-Mails Value to The E-mails that U Need to Send Mails to Them, and make sure there are in [] Every mail in single or duble quotation, i hope you understand :D
35     subject = "Mail Subject" >> Change "Mail Subject" with Your Subject
36     message = "Mail Message" >> Change "Mail Message" With Your "Message" you can use \n to go to the next line
37     attachment_path = 'File/Path.pdf' >> Change "File/Path.pdf" with your name of file u need to attachment it, if the file at the same folder with py code, or enter it Path from your PC if it dose not exist in folder of py project.

```

## Attach Two Files:
To attach two files as PDF, you can modify the `send_email` function to accept a list of attachment paths instead of a single path. Then, you can iterate over the attachment paths and attach each file to the email.
Here's an updated version of the `send_email` function that can handle multiple attachments:
```bash
def send_email(to_addresses, subject, message, attachment_paths):
    # Set up the email message
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = 'Your_Email_Or_User_Name'
    msg['To'] = ', '.join(to_addresses)
    msg['Subject'] = subject

    # Add the message to the email
    body = MIMEText(message)
    msg.attach(body)

    # Add the attachments to the email
    for attachment_path in attachment_paths:
        with open(attachment_path, 'rb') as file:
            attachment = MIMEApplication(file.read(), _subtype='pdf')
            attachment.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment', filename='File_Name.pdf')
            msg.attach(attachment)

    # Connect to the SMTP server and send the email
    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.office365.com', 587)
    server.starttls()
    server.login('Your_Email@outlook.com', 'Your_Password!')
    server.sendmail('Your_Email@outlook.com', to_addresses, msg.as_string())
    server.quit()
```

To use this function to send an email with two attachments, you can call it like this:

```bash
to_addresses = ['E-Mail@Example.com', 'E-Mail@Example.com', 'E-Mail@Example.com']
subject = "Mail Subject"
message = "Mail Message"
attachment_paths = ['File/Path1.pdf', 'File/Path2.pdf']
for address in to_addresses:
    send_email([address], subject, message, attachment_paths)
    print("[+] Mail Sended to :", address," ^.^")
    time.sleep(5)
```

This code will attach both `File/Path1.pdf` and `File/Path2.pdf` to the email message.

in order that when We Try to Send More and More E-Mails, Application will stop trmporary because spamming issue, we have to open the code and remove the mail that we have send to it, then try run application later.

"If you receive an error message indicating that your email has been blocked, you can try to unblock it by verifying your phone number. This can be done using the Microsoft Edge browser. If you are unsure about how to do this, You can take a look about this [Topic][Topic]. It is a Easy process, so there's no need to worry. If you are still hesitant, you could also consider creating a new account to use the tool."

## Appendix

* I have been add time to sleep some seconds between every E-Mail, that can hold the remporary banned some little.

## Known Issues
Any issues are usually because the underlying browser automation framework has a
bug or inconsistency. Where possible, we try to cover up these underlying
problems in the client, but sometimes workarounds require higher-level
intervention.
try to restart the code or change the vedio link
Please feel free to file an [issue][issue] if this client doesn't work as
expected.
